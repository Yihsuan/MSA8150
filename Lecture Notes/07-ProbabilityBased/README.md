# Probability-based Learning

This activity uses data from nextdoor.com. The data set is not sanitized. Therefore, I posted the raw data on the class D2L news board. Please, treat the data set carefully and do not publish or share.

The objective of this excercise is to utilize the Naive Bayes classifier to categorize messages according to various targets. E.g. can we predict if message are about items to sell, lost dogs, park clean-up, annexation and other political events, etc.

It would also be interesting to predict the length of a discussion thread.
